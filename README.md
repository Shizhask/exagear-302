## ‚ùìFAQ

#### WHY I'M DOING THIS ? :D
- I'm doing this for people that doesn't have that much storage or lack of storage. ^_^
- Also for people who only wants VirGL Renderer
#### Is their a system requirements for T+Z Acceleration ?
Minimum:
- Adreno 610 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 665, 680)
- Adreno 616 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 710, 712)
- Adreno 618 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G, 730, 730G, 732G)

Recommended:
- Adreno 640 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, 855+, 860)

- Adreno 650 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, 865+)
- Adreno 660 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, 888+)

#### WHAT IF MY PHONE DIDN'T REACHED T+Z REQUIREMENTS :'(

If your device isn't on the list or uses Mali-GPU or Adreno 5xx you can only run VirGL Renderer or LLVM.
- Requirements for VirGL: Support for OpenGL ES 2.1(3.0) and higher.

#### IS ADRENO 7XX T+Z RENDERER SUPPORTED ?
- Yes, But It's in very early stage and may not work at all.

#### DOES THIS SUPPORTED 64-BITS/X64 APPLICATIONS ?
- Absolutely no, this is ExaGear but much better and modified, but you may want to check [Box64Droid](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box64Droid) or [Box4Droid](https://github.com/Herick75/Box4Droid).
